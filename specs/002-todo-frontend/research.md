# Research Notes

This document contains research findings and decisions made during the planning phase.

## Phase 0: Initial Research

During the planning phase, one area identified for further clarification was the specific **frontend testing framework**.

**Decision**: The choice of a specific frontend testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress) is deferred to the task implementation phase. The implementation team will select an appropriate framework based on project needs and best practices, ensuring alignment with the project's testing requirements outlined in the Constitution (6.3 Testing Requirements).

**Rationale**: Deferring this decision allows the implementation team flexibility to choose the most suitable tool, as long as it meets the overarching testing principles. This avoids premature commitment to a specific tool before implementation details are fully considered.

**Alternatives Considered**:
-   Mandate a specific framework (e.g., Jest + React Testing Library): Rejected to allow flexibility.
-   Conduct a separate research spike: Deemed unnecessary for this phase, as the decision can be made during task breakdown.
