COMMAND: "/sp.specify You are Spec-Kit Plus acting as a senior frontend architect. Create a frontend specification for Phase III: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot. Scope: - FRONTEND ONLY - Phase III ONLY - OpenAI ChatKit UI - Next.js (App Router) - MUST be integrated into Phase II existing frontend - NO separate frontend application - Stateless frontend - Communicates with FastAPI backend - Authentication handled via Better Auth - Streaming AI responses supported Integration Requirement (Critical): - The chatbot UI must be embedded inside the existing Phase II Todo frontend - Reuse Phase II layout, auth flow, and user session - Chatbot should appear as: - A dedicated page (e.g. /chat) OR - A panel/modal within the existing app - No duplicate authentication or app shell Goals: - Extend the Phase II Todo app with a conversational AI interface - Allow users to manage tasks using natural language - Stream AI responses in real time - Preserve conversation continuity across sessions - Provide reminders and notifications UX Frontend Requirements: ### Core UI 1. Chat Interface - ChatKit-based conversational UI - Message bubbles for user and assistant - Streaming assistant responses (token-by-token) - Auto-scroll on new messages 2. Conversation Handling - Load previous conversations on page load - Allow resuming an existing conversation - Create new conversation when none exists - Display conversation history 3. Input Behavior - Single text input field - Enter to send - Disable input while agent is responding - Support multiline messages 4. Streaming Support - Render partial assistant responses - Show typing indicator while streaming - Finalize message after stream completes ### API Integration - POST /api/{user_id}/chat - Send conversation_id if available - Attach JWT token to Authorization header - Reuse Phase II API client patterns ### Authentication - Use existing Better Auth session from Phase II - Extract authenticated user_id - Prevent unauthenticated access - Handle 401/403 gracefully ### Task Awareness UI - AI confirmations displayed clearly - Tool actions summarized in chat - Friendly confirmations after task operations ### Notifications & Reminders - Browser notifications for task reminders - Sound alert when: - Task has 5 hours remaining - Every 15 minutes afterward - Permission request UX - Graceful fallback if notifications disabled ### Error Handling - Network failures - Streaming interruptions - Backend errors - User-friendly error messages ### Accessibility & UX - Keyboard navigation - Mobile responsive layout - Visual consistency with Phase II UI - Loading and empty states Out of Scope: - Backend logic - Database logic - Deployment setup - New authentication system Constraints: - Do NOT write actual frontend code - Do NOT create a new frontend app - Must reuse Phase II frontend structure - Stateless frontend Output Format: - Integration approach with Phase II frontend - UI components list - User interaction flows - Streaming behavior description - Error handling strategy - Ready for /sp.plan generation"
