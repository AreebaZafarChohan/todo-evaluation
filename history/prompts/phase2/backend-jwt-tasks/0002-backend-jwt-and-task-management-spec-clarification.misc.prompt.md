# Prompt

I have already asked Question 2 (PUT vs. PATCH Behavior). I am waiting for the user's response. I should not continue until the user provides an answer or explicit instruction to proceed.

Since I asked a question and am awaiting a response, I should not continue with any actions. I will re-prompt the user with the question.
Please continue.

# Response

All 5 clarification questions have been addressed and integrated into the specification. I have applied the recommended options directly as per the user's instruction.
