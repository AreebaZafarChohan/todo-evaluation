I have read the `plan.md` file. Now I will generate the tasks and write them to `specs/backend-jwt-tasks/tasks.md`.

I will break down the plan into a series of actionable tasks, following the phases outlined in the plan. Each task will be a concrete step towards implementing the backend.

# Response
