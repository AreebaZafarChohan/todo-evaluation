# backend-crud

## Description
Standardized CRUD operation patterns with repository pattern, DTOs, and consistent response formats.

## Core Principles
1. **Resource-Based**: RESTful URL design with proper HTTP verbs.
2. **Idempotency**: Safe to retry operations.
3. **Validation**: Validate at boundaries.
4. **Consistency**: Uniform response structure across all endpoints.
