# backend-testing

## Description
Standardized testing strategies for backend applications including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

## Core Principles
1. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing tests first.
2. **Isolation**: Unit tests must not touch the database or network.
3. **Database Sandboxing**: Use ephemeral databases for integration tests.
4. **Coverage**: Focus on business logic path coverage over line percentage.
