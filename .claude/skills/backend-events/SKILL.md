# backend-events

## Description
Event-driven architecture patterns with pub/sub, event sourcing, and message queue integration.

## Core Principles
1. **Loose Coupling**: Producers don't know consumers.
2. **Idempotency**: Handle duplicate events safely.
3. **Ordering**: Preserve order when required.
4. **Retry Strategy**: Dead letter queues for failed events.
