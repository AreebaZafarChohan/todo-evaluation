# backend-auth

## Description
Authentication and authorization patterns for backend applications including JWT, OAuth2, sessions, and role-based access control.

## Core Principles
1. **Defense in Depth**: Layered security with multiple validation checkpoints.
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum permissions required.
3. **Secure Tokens**: Use short-lived, signed tokens with proper rotation.
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all auth events for security monitoring.
