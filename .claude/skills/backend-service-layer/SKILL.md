# backend-service-layer
## Description
Implementation of the Service Layer pattern to decouple business logic from API controllers/routes.

## Core Principles
1. **Thin Controllers**: Controllers only handle requests/responses.
2. **Fat Services**: Business logic lives in the service layer.
3. **Reusability**: Services can be called by multiple controllers or background tasks.
