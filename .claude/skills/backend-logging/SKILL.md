# backend-logging

## Description
Structured logging patterns for backend applications with context, levels, and log aggregation compatibility.

## Core Principles
1. **Structured Logs**: Use JSON format for searchability.
2. **Context Correlation**: Include request IDs for tracing.
3. **Appropriate Levels**: Use log levels consistently.
4. **Sensitive Data**: Never log credentials or PII.
